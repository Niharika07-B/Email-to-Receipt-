# 📊 From Upload to Inbox — Billing Automation with AWS

This project is a fully automated, serverless billing system that extracts data from uploaded PDFs/images and sends real-time billing receipt emails — powered by AWS Cloud and Machine Learning.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Amazon S3** – For storing uploaded bills (PDFs/Images)
- **AWS Lambda** – Core logic for processing and automation
- **Amazon Textract** – ML model for extracting key-value data from documents
- **Amazon DynamoDB** – Stores structured billing data
- **Amazon SES** – Sends email receipts
- **IAM** – Secure roles and access control between services
- **Python** – Used for Lambda functions

---

## 💡 Features

- Upload a bill (PDF or image) to S3
- Automatically trigger a Lambda function
- Extract billing details using Amazon Textract
- Save the structured data to DynamoDB
- Email the receipt to the customer using SES
- 100% Serverless and real-time automation

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
⚠️ Make sure you have appropriate AWS IAM access before proceeding.

1.Create an S3 Bucket

 Enable event trigger on object creation for Lambda

2.Deploy Lambda Function

  Add environment variables like:

    TABLE_NAME, SENDER_EMAIL, RECIPENT_EMAIL


  Attach IAM Role with access to:

    S3, Textract, DynamoDB, SES

3.Set Up DynamoDB

Create a table with appropriate keys (e.g., invoice_id)

4.Verify Email in SES

verify sender email addresses


##📌 Key Takeaways
S3: Learned how to trigger workflows on file uploads

DynamoDB: Understood fast, flexible NoSQL data modeling

IAM: Set up secure role-based access between AWS services

Lambda: Became confident in deploying/debugging serverless functions

Textract: Got hands-on with ML for document parsing

Environment Variables: One small typo in a key name caused a silent fail — painful but educational 😅
